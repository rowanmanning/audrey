# Audrey

Audrey is a simple single-user feed reader, focused on a no-frills reading experience. Audrey allows you to subscribe to [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feeds and read content in one place.

Audrey is self-hosted; you can set up an installation on your own server or cloud provider. There's no creepy harvesting of your data, and no algorithms to recommend new content.

**[Note: Audrey is currently in beta](#beta-notice)**

## Requirements

This application requires the following to run:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.0.0+
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) v4.0.0+


## Running locally

You can run Audrey locally if you intend on making your own changes, or just want to test it out. Follow theses steps to get Audrey running on your local machine:

  1. Make sure you have all of the software listed in [Requirements](#requirements)

  2. Clone this repository, and `cd` into it:

        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/rowanmanning/audrey.git && cd audrey
        ```

  3. Install the application dependencies:

        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

  4. Copy the sample `.env` file to make changes to the [configuration](#config-options). You'll need to do this if you want sessions to persist between restarts of the application. The following command copies `sample.env` to `.env`:

        ```sh
        make env
        ```

  5. Start the application in production mode:

        ```sh
        make start
        ```

        Or development mode if you want code changes to auto-restart the application:

        ```sh
        make start-dev
        ```

  6. Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser (the port may be different if you made changes to the default `.env` file)

  7. Set up a password on the locally running site. You'll need to remember this password to regain access if your session expires


## Running on a server

The instructions for running on a server are the same as [running locally](#running-locally) apart from the following differences:

  * It may not be possible to create an `.env` file, dependent on your setup. You'll need a different way to provide configurations via environment variables

  * The URL to access the application will be whatever your public server address is, rather than `localhost`


## Cloud provider guides

Audrey has guides for the following common cloud providers:

  * [Deploy Audrey on Glitch](docs/guide/glitch.md) (free and paid options)
  * [Deploy Audrey on Heroku](docs/guide/heroku.md) (free and paid options)


## Config options

This application is configured using environment variables, or an [`.env` file](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) if you're running locally. The following options are available:

  - **`MONGODB_URI`**: A MongoDB connection string, used to connect to the database.<br/>
    Default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/audrey`

  - **`NODE_ENV`**: The environment to run the application in, one of `production`, `development`, `test`.<br/>
    Default: `development`.

  - **`PORT`**: The HTTP port to run the application on. If set to an empty string, a random port will be assigned.<br/>
    Default: `8080`.

  - **`SESSION_SECRET`**: A secret key for session hashing. If this is not set, a random key will be used on each restart of the application. This will cause sessions to drop off, and is very annoying in development.

  - **`UPDATE_SCHEDULE`**: A [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) which specifies when Audrey should refresh all of the feeds you're subscribed to. If you're unsure how to write cron expressions, [this site helps](https://crontab.guru/).<br/>
    Default: `0 */2 * * *` (every 2 hours).

You can also change more configurations through the settings page of a running copy of Audrey, these additional configurations are stored in the database.

### Demo mode

**Do not use demo mode on your main feed reader – it will result in loss of data**. Audrey can be placed into "demo mode" by using setting a hidden config option in the database. It's important to note that placing an installation in demo mode will do the following things:

  - You will no longer need to log in with a password, all data (including settings) will be viewable by anyone who visits the site

  - You will no longer be able to change site settings or feed settings

  - You will no longer be able to subscribe to new feeds

  - Every 15 minutes, all entries in the database will be removed and all feeds will be refreshed

These changes are designed to allow Audrey to be publicly viewable without the risk of unwanted data being added to your database.

The only way to enable demo mode is to manually change the settings in your database. You can do so using the following while connected to MongoDB:

```js
db.settings.updateMany({}, {$set: {demoMode: true}})
```


## Beta notice

Audrey is currently in beta, and may not have all of the features you expect from a feed reader yet. I'm deliberately keeping a reduced set of features, but please check the [feature label](https://github.com/rowanmanning/audrey/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature) in the [issues](https://github.com/rowanmanning/audrey/issues) before requesting anything

I really appreciate feedback on the stability of Audrey, if you're willing to give it a go as your primary feed reader then I'll be happy to address any bugs you come across during your day-to-day use.
